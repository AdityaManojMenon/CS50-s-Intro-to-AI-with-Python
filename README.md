Projects included in CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course


[Degrees](https://github.com/AdityaManojMenon/CS50-s-Intro-to-AI-with-Python/tree/main/Degrees) - A program that determines how many “degrees of separation” apart two actors are.

[Knights](https://github.com/AdityaManojMenon/CS50-s-Intro-to-AI-with-Python/tree/main/Knights) - A program to solve logic puzzles

[Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/AdityaManojMenon/CS50-s-Intro-to-AI-with-Python/tree/main/Tic-Tac-Toe) - Using Minimax, implementing an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally

[Minesweeper](https://github.com/AdityaManojMenon/CS50-s-Intro-to-AI-with-Python/tree/main/Minesweeper) - An AI agent capable of gathering information about the Minesweeper board and selecting cells that are determined to be safe. This knowledge-based AI makes decisions by evaluating its knowledge base and drawing inferences accordingly.

[PagerRank](https://github.com/AdityaManojMenon/CS50-s-Intro-to-AI-with-Python/tree/main/PageRank) - This project implements both  approaches for calculating PageRank – calculating both by sampling pages from a Markov Chain random surfer and by iteratively applying the PageRank formula.

[Heredity](https://github.com/AdityaManojMenon/CS50-s-Intro-to-AI-with-Python/tree/main/Heredity) - This project models the inheritance and expression of the GJB2 gene, which causes hearing impairment, using a Bayesian Network. It accounts for Mendelian genetics and the probability of gene mutation, linking parental genes to a child's gene and genes to trait expression. The AI infers the probability distributions of gene states and hearing impairment traits in a population based on observed genetic and familial data

[Crossword](https://github.com/AdityaManojMenon/CS50-s-Intro-to-AI-with-Python/tree/main/Crossword) - This project involves developing a program to generate a crossword puzzle by modeling it as a constraint satisfaction problem. Each sequence of squares is treated as a variable, defined by its position, direction, and length. The program applies unary constraints (word length) and binary constraints (overlapping letters between neighboring words) to ensure a valid crossword. Additionally, the program ensures all words used are unique, finding a satisfying assignment from a given list of words that meets all constraints.

[Shopping](https://github.com/AdityaManojMenon/CS50-s-Intro-to-AI-with-Python/tree/main/Shopping) - This project involves developing a k-nearest-neighbor classifier to predict user purchasing intent based on session data from an online shopping website. By preprocessing and transforming raw data into a suitable format, the model can effectively analyze user behavior patterns and generate predictions. The model's performance is evaluated using sensitivity and specificity metrics to ensure a balanced assessment of its accuracy. This approach aims to provide actionable insights that can help optimize content delivery and improve user experience on the shopping website.
